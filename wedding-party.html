										<h3>- BROTHER -</h3>
										<p>
											Karsten is Karina’s dear big brother. As her only sibling, they share a love of California,
											a silly and goofy humor, and a joy for going on neighborhood runs. Kind, unceasingly supportive,
											and always loyal, Karsten is truly the best big brother you could ask for. From March-June of 2020,
											Karina and Tony were able to live with Brie and Karsten in San Diego for about eight weeks. This
											invaluable and unexpected time together was truly a gift and it allowed Karina and Karsten to
											hang out in a way they haven’t done since childhood. Plus, Karsten got a first hand look at some
											of Karina and Tony’s earliest whisperings of marriage, delivering loving side eyes to Tony as he
											noticed that Tony wasn’t planning on going anywhere. Karina loves watching Karsten be a new dad and is
											eternally grateful to have a brother as cool, calm, and collected as Karsten.

										<h3>- SISTER-IN-LAW -</h3>
										<p>
											Karina and Brie’s friendship started in college when Brie was Karina’s Resident Advisor. After graduation,
											Karina lived with Brie and Karsten for about nine months and Brie quickly became the big 
											sister that Karina never had. Now, Brie is an expert at frequent, quick phone calls to say 
											hi and check in. She is “go with the flow”, flexible, and always willing to host friends and 
											family at their home in San Diego. The best thing about Brie is that she really lives what it 
											means to put family first. She’s always plotting for the next Olsen family gathering. Plus, 
											her commitment to getting Karsten to play board games with the family has made her and Karina 
											an unstoppable duo. As a new mama, she’s an expert at thrifting, DIY projects, and constantly 
											demonstrating how to be graceful, especially when Shae is flinging food across
											the kitchen.

										  <h3>- CHILDHOOD BFF -</h3>
										  <p>
											Katy is Karina’s oldest friend of the bunch and they met at Clairbourn Preschool before they 
											could talk. After Karina’s family moved away from CA, the two were only able to 
											reunite a couple times a year throughout their entire childhood. With summers spent on Balboa,
											scootering around on Razors and getting ice cream from Dad’s Ice Cream Shop, most 
											of their 27 years of friendship has been long distance! It wasn’t until college that they were 
											able to hang out every day and even be roommates for a semester. Now, Katy and Karina both live 
											in Boston and their lifelong friendship is still a special treasure to them both. They get to 
											casually hang out on the weekends, cook dinners together, or head north for a weekend ski trip. 
											You can bet they’ve got their matching broken heart “best-friend” necklaces buried deep in 
											a dresser drawer somewhere.

										  <h3>- HIGH SCHOOL OG -</h3>
										  <p>
											Erica is an OG homie from Wilton, CT, ever since the 3rd grade. Fun fact: it was a 
											delirious 4am trip to the Danbury mall on Black Friday in highschool which led to 
											Erica’s originating of the term “Ladies”, a name which Karina and her high school 
											friends frequently call themselves. Since the days of girl scouts, soccer practice, 
											and routine sleepovers, Erica has been a best friend through it all. Now, she’s 
											living in Colorado, crushing graduate school, excelling in the field of green-building 
											design and policy, and living life to the fullest. She sets out on epic adventures, like 
											getting her avalanche training certificate for backcountry skiing or 
											hiking 14-ers with her dogs and fiance. Beyond that, Erica is one of the most genuine 
											and silliest people you’ll ever meet. It would be remiss to end this bio without a 
											quick note saying... “Can I get a ladiessss?!?”

										  <h3>- FIRST CO, FIRST LOVE -</h3>
										  <p>
											Truth be told about Wendy, she was actually Tony’s friend first. But after their first summer 
											as co-counselors together at Camp Newfound in 2012, Karina and Wendy became inseparable adventure 
											buddies. From skiing all over the country, traveling internationally, hiking in the PNW, and 
											spending the last four New Year’s Eves together, the two always find themselves back in planning 
											mode for the next big trip. Whether it's hiking, sailing, kayaking, or biking, Wendy's always down. 
											When she’s not adventuring, Wendy is either mentoring high school and elementary school students, 
											studying hard at the University of Washington, planning a themed dance party, or selflessly sharing 
											her camping gear with others. She has the biggest heart and a love for learning. It’s now a decade 
											after Karina and Wendy’s first year on Newfound staff together as co-counselors and their friendship 
											is stronger than ever as they cheerfully reminisce, “first co, first love!”

										  <h3>- CAMP & COLLEGE BESTIE -</h3>
										  <p>
											No matter where life takes them, Georgia and Karina always find themselves pondering and learning 
											about the same big ideas. From plotting as college roommates about relationships to learning 
											how to “do adulthood”, Georgia is the friend who will spend hours with you on the phone, 
											listening to your every crazy idea or inkling, and celebrating your hopes and dreams. The 
											two share a love for chocolate, Maine, and waterskiing, after their many summers at camp 
											together. Georgia keeps Karina up to date with the latest beauty products and has been a 
											constant cheerleader throughout the entire wedding planning process. As a recent mom to 
											the most adorable twin girls, Sadie Jane and Henley, Georgia is always putting her loved 
											ones first. These days, you’ll find her in the Midwest, teaching Karina from afar about 
											the joys and surprises of motherhood and homeownership, all while helping her husband with 
											their family business, Fort Worth Running Company.

											<h3>- BOSTON ROOMMATE -</h3>
											<p>
												Fashionista, Lauren Littell, can take almost all the credit (along with Meridee) for 
												Karina’s fashion knowledge. Nobody knows Karina’s wardrobe better than Lauren and as 
												current roommates in Boston, she is Karina’s #1 consultant for almost any new purchase. 
												Lauren is also a true “foodie”, so she and Karina are always analyzing and critiquing 
												their latest meal. A weekend with Lauren and Karina includes blasting Maggie Rogers in 
												the car, a long ride on their new road bikes, and hunting around for the yummiest, 
												local food they can find. But deeper than weekend plans and Friday night shenanigans, 
												Lauren’s friendship has been a rock to Karina through their years in college and young 
												adulthood. As both employees of The Mother Church, they cherish their time living in Boston 
												together and serving their loved & shared religion. Plus, just one or two nudges from Lauren 
												set the Karina & Tony relationship buds into full bloom!

									  <h3>- SISTER -</h3>
									  <p>
										Tony and Katie share a special sibling bond, forged by the childhood dinner cycle of baked 
										chicken and rice, leftover chicken and bean burritos, and chicken broth ramen. A typical 
										childhood summer consisted of trips to Yosemite and the family cottage with all 
										the cousins in Harpswell, Maine. In adulthood, the adventures continued with an expanded playground, 
										but the same childlike joy and love for spending quality time together in the outdoors. 
										More recently, Tony and Katie’s plot to get their parents excited about skiing has worked 
										to perfection and Randy and Carolyn logged 50+ days on the slopes last year. Katie is fearless 
										and dedicated when it comes to all things adventure, whether it’s skiing double black diamonds, 
										trail running up a mountain, 
										or flying cross-country for a weekend in Baxter State Park. As the sibling adventures began 
										including Karina, it’s been a blessing that Katie and Karina have such a close relationship 
										of their own. Official sisterhood is just around the corner!

									  <h3>- CO DANCING DESSERT DUDE -</h3>
									  <p>
										Andrew is a true renaissance man: singer, photographer, painter, drawer, dancer, and chef. 
										They just don’t make men the way Andrew was made anymore. Tony and Andrew became friends as 
										counselors at Owatonna and then really became besties once they both moved to Boston around 
										the same time in fall of 2017. Andrew is  liable to FaceTime you at 5pm and ask if you want 
										him to come over to YOUR apartment and cook dinner or bake goodies together. Except, when he’s 
										the professional cook of the duo, “together” usually just means riffing off each other’s goonery 
										while he does all the actual cooking. That pattern led to the sadly short-lived formation of "The
										Dancing Dessert Dudes" - an Instagram account where Andrew and Tony made desserts and shamelessly 
										danced around the kitchen. Andrew is wonderfully spontaneous, a true “yes man” when convincing 
										him to join in on a crazy idea, and is one of the nicest guys you’ll ever meet.

									  <h3>- HUNNEWELL BUNKMATE -</h3>
									  <p>
										It was mac & cheese Mondays, burning the midnight oil at SFLT (Second Floor Long Tables in the Olin Library, 
										for the uninitiated), and the WashU Ultimate Frisbee team that started Tony and Nirek’s friendship. Their 
										spring break road trip in 2017 alluded to the type of adventures that would fill their future: a distinct 
										lack of planning, a certain optimism about their capabilities, and a habit of forgoing proper sleep for 
										unforgettable memories. Fast forward to 2019, Nirek moved to Boston to become roommates with Tony, Matt, 
										and Van in their apartment, affectionately known as “Beluga Heights”. Most people wouldn’t opt to sleep 
										in a bunk bed as an adult with a real income... but, Nirek and Tony aren’t most people and their friendship 
										only grew stronger after voluntarily deciding to become bunkmates. Nirek is the ultimate hype-man, a living
										defintion of loyalty, and he'll pump
										you up for the tinest victories. He's the kind of friend who will pick your girlfriend up from the airport at 5am if you’re not home to do it 
										yourself. He has an infectious proclivity for buckets, is thoughtful and kind, and best of all, ladies, 
										he is single!

									  <h3>- CHILDHOOD CAMP FRIEND -</h3>
									  <p>
										Cody and Tony are life long summer camp friends dating all the way back to Cabin 9 in 
										2006 when Cody showed up with an infamous mullet hair-do and tie dye bedding. Since then, 
										they have spent nine summers together at Camp Owatonna. From big adventures, like their Maine 
										Island trail JC sea kayaking trip and Allagash Wilderness Waterway canoe trip, to the daily 
										shenanigans and 5am adirondack showers before Sunday cabin cleanup, summers in Maine with 
										Cody were always one of Tony’s favorite parts of the year. For their final summer together in 2016, 
										they were co-counselors leading the Counselor in Training program in what was one of the 
										most demanding and rewarding summers of them all. When Cody and Cassidy became roommates 
										with Tony and Nirek in Boston, Tony’s worlds collided in the best way. Cody became the Among 
										Us ringleader and the whole Boston friend group became hooked! As a captivating and hilarious 
										story teller, nobody can make Tony squeal with laughter like Cody can. It was such a special 
										time to live with Cody and Cass before they moved out West to pursue the next chapter of their 
										lives.

									  <h3>-INTERNATIONAL SWIMSUIT MODEL-</h3>
									  <p>
										Nate and Tony were both long-time campers at Owatonna, but didn’t truly become 
										great friends until they were on staff together. Nate and Jordan Anderson taught Tony the 
										art of the DOFF in the summer of 2013 - packing maximum adventure and activity 
										into their days off together. Then, a trip to Spain with Karina and Wendy 
										sealed the deal on a lifelong friendship for Nate and Tony, especially after buying matching 
										short-short swimtrunks. When he's not waterskiing and gettin' buoys, Nate might be confused for a 
										professional homemade pasta and pizza extraordinaire. 
										He is the perfect foil to Tony's lackluster 
										“long distance keeping in touch” skills; frequently calling Tony while driving in Seattle 
										traffic or walking Mischa, he's always ready to catch up or ask for the Round Report on Tony and 
										Kenny's latest Maple Hill disc golf excursion. A quick call and Nate's listening ear makes
										the distance disappear and with any luck, Tony and Nate won’t be on opposite coasts for too much longer.

									  <h3>- FELLOW GREEN -</h3>
									  <p>
										Although Kenny couldn’t quite recruit Tony to Principia College, he did much better the 
										second time around, convincing Tony to move to Boston after college. During Tony’s senior 
										year, a weekend trip full of rugby, ultimate frisbee in the snow, and bopping around 
										different parts of Boston really sealed the deal. After Tony officially moved to Brighton, 
										they maintained the active pace as the “most single dudes in Boston” spending most weekends 
										exploring the Northeast, road tripping to Florida, and everything in between. Kenny’s 
										friendship was one of the main factors that made Tony’s move to Boston so seamless. Kenny 
										was also a founding member of the Rose Buds - a group of dedicated Bachelor fans that 
										convened weekly to watch the Bachelor and inadvertently received noise complaints from 
										the Strathmore neighbors. Let’s be honest, it was Crystal’s fault. 4+ years later, Kenny 
										and Tony are now roommates and planning their 2022 weddings in parallel!

										<h3>- COLLEGE ROOMMATE -</h3>
										<p>
											The laundry list of freshman year shenanigans was long, but if there was a noise complaint 
											on Keonig 1 (there were many) the duo was likely to be involved. With dorms across the hall 
											from one another, the two instantly became friends. Spontaneous dancing sessions to Timber 
											by Kesha, heated 2v2 Fifa matches, and late night hallway chats were staples of  Freshman year. 
											The summer after graduating, the duo delayed the start of “the real world” with a month-long 
											road trip throughout the American West and Canadian Rockies. The trip was full of gorgeous 
											views, challenging yet rewarding outdoor experiences, and nightly pillow talks, often about 
											the exciting unknown that lay ahead in their imminent young adult lives. Sach now lives 
											in Denver which is perfect for winter ski trips and summer hikes. In 2020, Karina and Tony skied 
											with Sach at Copper Mountain followed by hiking their first 14er, Mt. Bierstadt, with Sach in the summer!
